1.0.1
NO API CHANGES.
Fixed a bug caused by a typo "ANotUsableClass" was not removed.
Added few more tests.

Fixed multiple inheritance bug, now void* cast is no longer arbitrary
but is done using a map that contain each conversion to each base
virtual class (see Unit Test n° 4-5, actually those tests were failing
I Need to improve test suite, test should be automatic, actually
I need to look at few of them to determine if they are working...)


1.0.0

First release.
