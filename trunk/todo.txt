0) Reduce compile time? not really required for now. But is theorically possible,
most methods works on the type std::type_index rather than a generic type T, so
much of the logic can be moved to a NON-templated class. This will be done
without breaking existing interface of course. but not now. There are most
interesting things to do than refactoring what is currently working very nice:)

1)
Exceptions are just temporary.

In future exception messages will look like:
"Cannot wire constructor for FooBar, because type 'FooBar' was not bound 
(to bind a type use Infector::Container.bind...< ... >() )"

or
"Cannot build FooBar, an exception was thrown by its constructor"


2)
Custom allocation:
When A dependends on B and B depends on C the smartest way to allocate A is by
reserving a memory chunk of lenght A+B+C (Eventually alignin it) and then 
constructing A,B,C using the placement new 

raw chunk:
|---------------------------|
after placement new:
|-A-|-------B-------|---C---|

The natural way to do this construction is to use the evaluation order of 
constructors that make implemenation easy (and possibly fast).

This require a new smart pointer ( shared_ptr and unique_ptr provides some
mechanism for custom deleters, but that's expensive).

And the name for the new pointer will be ..

infect_ptr ?

then infect_ptr will be a "replacement"  for unique_ptr

3)
Construct arrays of objects? (it's implicit that "Single" types can't be 
costructed into arrays, so there will not be "buildSingleArray" in any case).

auto myArray = ioc.buildArray<IFoo>(50); 

for(int i=0; i<50; i++)
 myArray[i]; //would that be usefull? would that be misused?


4) hierarchical containers (HC)
Actually multiple containers are possible, but each container don't
see each other... Then provide a hierachical structure where
children can see dependencies of parents? (or eventually change them?)

Would that be usefull for someone?
